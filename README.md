# flight_system
Using MySQLWorkbench, I developed a database for the aforementioned project's flight booking system for domestic flights. First, using an entity-relationship diagram and four entities—tickets, passengers, flights, and airports—I developed a conceptual model. Based on this model I created a logical model including 2 other entities, flight class and airline. Then I built a physical model on MySQLWorkbench and assigned foreign keys and primary keys to each table. I used forward engineering to finally develop the database.
